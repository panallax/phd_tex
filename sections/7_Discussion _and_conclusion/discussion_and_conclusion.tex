This chapter aims to serve as an account of the objectives achieved and the results obtained during the course of this work. 
However, first, a section is included analysing the behaviour and adaptability of the structure generation algorithm developed.
It also aims to highlight the advantage of the structures obtained over those most commonly used for the design of bone scaffolds. 
Finally, future lines of research and improvement are proposed for both the algorithm developed and the applications studied in this work.
